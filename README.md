## Marketing & Sales Performance Analysis (Python Project)

A complete end-to-end marketing and sales analytics project using Python, focused on understanding revenue drivers, campaign effectiveness, platform performance, and regional sales behavior.
This project demonstrates real-world analytical skills used in data-driven marketing and business intelligence.

### Project Overview

This project analyzes a multi-dimensional marketing dataset containing revenue, ad spend, clicks, item sales, regional data, client information, and platform performance.
The goal is to uncover insights that help businesses optimize budget allocation, identify high-value customers, and improve overall marketing ROI.

### Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
CSV data processing
EDA visuals & insights
PowerPoint presentation for executives

### Dataset Summary

The dataset includes ~150 unique rows with columns such as:
Date
Revenue
AdSpend
Clicks
ItemSales
Region
Platform
CampaignName
ClientName
AgeGroup
The data was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to build meaningful KPIs and insights.

### Key Metrics Engineered

To enhance analysis, the following KPIs were computed:

Metric	Description
CPC (Cost Per Click)	AdSpend ÷ Clicks
CPS (Cost Per Sale)	AdSpend ÷ ItemSales
Revenue Per Click	Revenue ÷ Clicks
Profit	Revenue − AdSpend
Monthly	Extracted from Date column

These metrics help assess campaign efficiency, sales effectiveness, and profitability.

### Key Insights

Revenue is heavily concentrated in a few key regions and top clients.
Some platforms deliver high ROI, while others show inefficiencies.
Several campaigns can be scaled, while underperformers need rework.
Seasonal patterns exist, making the data suitable for forecasting.
Strong correlation between Clicks, ItemSales, and Revenue indicates predictable performance drivers.

🎯 Strategic Recommendations

Increase budget for high-performing platforms and campaigns.
Optimize or reduce spend on low-ROI regions and channels.
Add retention plans for high-value clients.
Use monthly patterns for forecast-based budgeting.
Consider expanding into high-potential mid-tier regions.
More forward-looking strategies are included in the final presentation.
